mileage.R
=========

The mileage.R script takes US Dept. of Energy fuel economy data and
produces two plots:
1) A boxplot of fuel economy for manual transmission vehicles by
   manufacturer.
2) Fuel economy for 2012 manual transmission cars, station wagons, and
   minivans by model (minimum combined MPG is set at 20).

The data for comes from the USDoE spreadsheet that can be found here:
http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/epadata/12data.zip

The data is contained within a Excel spreadsheet, and the
2012_FEGuide.csv file in the project is just the Excel exported as a
csv, since I find it easier to deal with these than trying to pull the
Excel sheet into R.
